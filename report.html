    <h1>Itemized account of how I believe I met expectations for Project 1.</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>My site is for Blugold Dining here at UWEC</li>
        <li>My site has a header but is mostly used for mobile devices. Desktop there is still a heading at the top of each page. </li>
        <li>The 5 pages on my site are: home page, locations and hours, meal plans, frequently asked questions, and an about page.</li>
        <li>Site uses a navigation bar with links to the other pages and uses a drop down menu for mobile. </li>
        <li>I use media queries to handle layouts for small screens. The changes made when going from large to small is image resizing, font resize, and change the navigation bar from a bar to a drop down.</li>
        <li>I have a global stylesheet that is also used for the home page style sheet and then each other page has their own style sheet.</li>
        <li>Images are included with an alt tag.</li>
        <li>Favicon implemented on each page.</li>
        <li>Css files, js files, and images in seperate folders. I kept favicon in with the html</li>
        <li>No external libraries are used. </li>
        <li>When checking the HTML validator, I keep getting an error that said the character encoding was not declared. Other than that, the html looked good.</li>
        <li>My git repository was shared with Chris on slack as well as with twodee on git.</li>
        <li>All file names are lower case </li>
        <li>Served out of port 8443.</li>
        <li>Only accessible through HTTPS.</li>
        <li>Content is aligned with straight lines.</li>
        <li>Mix use of fonts throughout site, mostly sans-serif</li>
        <li>On the meal plan page, the user has to click on the meal plan they wish to see and then it displays that meal plan. Another case would be the drop down menu on the mobile version of the site.</li>
        <li>Link is added to UWEC dining instagram page for updates about food surveys</li>
        <li>Source code readable and uses meaningful names for variables and classes.</li>
        <li>Uses an animation on the meal plan page for displaying meal plans.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I got permission from my boss, Daniel Raney, to use the images found on the website.</p>
    <p>With the client report, I took some of the spelling mistakes and corrected them. 
        I left them in the report but highlighted red to indicate what I switched and what I left alone.
    </p>
    <p>The report was written by Emily OldenBurg, a student manager at Davies Center marketplace, and transfered word for word into this report.</p>

    <p>Likes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I like the home page! It's simple and sweet. It has easy access to the other tabs on this website</li>
        <li>Good to keep students up to date with how things are going on campus right now with the corona virus</li>
        <li>I like you having the prices for the meal plans and having categories for what meal plans are for on campus and for off campus</li>
        <li>I like the descriptions for the meal plans in terms of what meal plan is best for each college student</li>
        <li>It was a good idea to have a FAQs tab along with the declining dollars and ways that they can use it up</li>
        <li>Overall, it's very organized and it's easy on the eyes in terms of the font and spacing between topics/paragraphs</li>
        <li>It definitely shows that you know what you're talking about and it seems like it does come from a reliable source </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Improvements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For locations and hours, you can maybe change the weekdays, like for MarketPlace, you can have it say Mon-Thur: 7am-7pm (instead of M,T,W,TH) -> it just looks better/more professional in my opinion</li>
        <li class="red">I would say it should be capitalized, so Davies Center (the "c" wasn't initially capitalized on the home page)
            <ul>
                <li>On-campus meal plans -&gt; platinum plan - capitalize "c"</li>
                <li>Off-campus -&gt; block meal plan - capitalize "c" on the 4th line</li>
                <li>Off-campus -&gt; 50/50 block meal plan - capitalize "c" on the 5th line</li>
                <li>Off-campus -&gt; 60 block meal plan - capitalize the "c" on the 5th line</li>
                <li>Off-campus -&gt; blugold diners club - capitalize the "c" on the 4th line</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="red">What is "Eaccounts" on the 50/50 block meal plan? Is it spelled like "Eaccounts" or "E-accounts"? or does it not matter</li>
        <li>Should it be spelled as on-campus and off-campus? (with a dash)</li>
        <li class="red">Under Blugold Diners Club, it should be spelt as "Diners" and then throughout that section of the meal plan, fix it to "diners" and not "dinners" (might have to fix it on other tabs if you have it other places) 
            <ul>
                <li>For this line, "Each week there are coupons or promotions at <b>dining</b> locations around campus. Keep a look out on your home page for these offers."</li>
                <li>"Dinner club <b>members</b> get a 10% discount â€¦"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For locations and hours, move the logos a little bit up so that they're more centered</li>
        <li>Maybe when you're talking about meal plans, be consistent with saying Davies Center every time you talk about it, not just say Davies</li>
        <li class="red">For the FAQs, the second question should say "declining dollars left" instead of just declining (like if it's a new student, they may not understand just saying declining</li>
        <li>The About tab, the first paragraph at the end, it's spelled as "pleasant" not "pleasent"
            <ul>
                <li>Second paragraph, "<b>caf&eacute;s</b> and restaurants" (needs an accent on the "e")</li>
                <li class="red">Last paragraph, "<b>recommendations</b>" (two m's)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    </body>
