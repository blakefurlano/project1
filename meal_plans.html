            Meal plans allow students and faculty to eat at a variety of locations on campus everyday. Each meal plan
            has different
            benefits, so read them all to find one that is best for you.

        </p>
        <p class="content">
            There are four meal plans for on campus students and three meal plans that are geared toward off campus
            students.
            Students living on campus in Chancellors Hall are not required to buy a meal plan, but students living in
            all other
            resident halls are required to have a meal plan.

            Generally, first year students do not get this plan nor does Blugold dining recommend this plan for first year students. It
            is still available, but incoming students find a meal plan with block meals much more convenient.
