        Near the end of each semester, we offer bulk order forms that allows students to buy items we offer in Davies center but in bulk.
        Once the form is filled out and turned in to a Davies cashier before the deadline, students can expect a 
        few days turn-around for their items which can be picked up at Davies Center Marketplace. Details about when the forms will

        this website along with a printable version of the form.
