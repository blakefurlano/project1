            These are some common questions that both new and current students have asked or some things that we here
            at Blugold dining think are important.

    <h2 class = "question">Q: What is considered a Block Meal?</h2>
    <p class="content">
        A block meal consists of an entree, side, and drink in Davies Center Marketplace, The Cabin, and Einstein Bros. Bagels. 
        On upper campus, a block meal can be used at Hilltop Riverview Cafe and is a buffet style meal where you can eat
        as much as you would like during the visit. 
    </p>
    <h2 class = "question">Q: I have a lot of declining left and the semester is almost over, how can I use it up?</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Near the end of each semester, we offer bulk order forms that allows students to buy items we offer in Davies center but in bulk.
        Once the form is filled out and turned in to a Davies cashier before the deadline, students can expect a 
        few days turn-around for their items which can be picked up at Davies Center Marketplace. Details about when the forms will 
        be available and the turn in deadline will be announced closer to the end of the semester. This information can be found on 
        this website along with a printable version of the form.

    </p>
    <h2 class = "question">Q: Can students work at the dining locations?</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Yes! Students are encouraged to apply at any of the dining locations as new students are needed each semester. Blugold 
        Dining offers many different positions from stocking, cashiering, and paths to becoming a student manager. We 
        offer competitive pay and each shift you work you will recieve a voucher for a free block meal for the next day or a day 
        of your choosing. Students can apply via Handshake and searching for "Blugold Dining UW-Eau Claire". We understand that 
        students are students first so we work with each student worker and are flexible and understanding of the working 
        college student lifestyle.
